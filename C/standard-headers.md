# Standard Include Header Files in C

This is a list of standard include header files in C, along with their use cases:

## stdio.h

- Use case: Input and output operations, such as reading from and writing to files, standard input/output (stdin/stdout), and formatted input/output (printf/scanf) functions. Commonly used for handling input and output operations in C programs.

## stdlib.h

- Use case: General-purpose utility operations, such as memory allocation and deallocation (malloc/free), conversion functions (atoi/atof), random number generation (rand), and other commonly used functions. Commonly used for memory management, type conversions, and other utility operations in C programs.

## string.h

- Use case: String manipulation, such as copying strings (strcpy/strncpy), concatenating strings (strcat/strncat), comparing strings (strcmp/strncmp), and other string-related operations. Commonly used for handling strings, such as manipulating and comparing strings, in C programs.

## ctype.h

- Use case: Character classification and manipulation, such as checking for alphabetic, numeric, or whitespace characters (isalpha/isdigit/isspace), converting characters to uppercase or lowercase (toupper/tolower), and other character-related operations. Commonly used for character handling and manipulation in C programs.

## math.h

- Use case: Mathematical operations, such as basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and other mathematical computations. Commonly used for performing mathematical calculations in C programs, such as numerical calculations, geometry, and other mathematical operations.

## time.h

- Use case: Time and date operations, such as getting the current time (time), converting time values (gmtime/localtime/strftime), and other time-related operations. Commonly used for handling time and date information in C programs, such as working with timestamps, measuring time intervals, and formatting time values.

## stdbool.h

- Use case: Boolean data type (bool) and boolean constants (true/false), used for logical operations in C. Commonly used for boolean operations, such as logical expressions and conditional statements, in C programs.

## stddef.h

- Use case: Definitions for commonly used types and macros, such as size_t (unsigned integer type used for representing sizes), NULL (a null pointer constant), and other standard types. Commonly used for defining types and macros that are commonly used in C programs, such as working with sizes, null pointers, and other standard types.
